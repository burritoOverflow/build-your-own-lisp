## Build Your Own Lisp

Implementation follows [The Web Version of the Book](https://www.buildyourownlisp.com/chapter4_interactive_prompt#read_evaluate_print).

Assumes (and requires) `readline` is installed along with the author's [mpc library](https://github.com/orangeduck/mpc.git). `mpc`'s default `PREFIX` is `/usr/lib` and the `Makefile` assumes this is the case.
